# Hardware Info Retriever üñ•Ô∏èüîç

A simple batch script to retrieve hardware information such as UUID, serial number, model, and manufacturer from your system. The script includes a small animation effect to simulate processing while retrieving the data.

## Features ‚ú®

- **Animated Loader:** Displays a small animation before retrieving the hardware information.
- **Hardware Details:** Retrieves and displays your system's UUID, serial number, model, and manufacturer using `WMIC` commands.
- **User-Friendly:** Designed for easy use with no additional dependencies.

## How to Use üõ†Ô∏è

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hu5o-dev/HWIDFinder.git
   cd HWIDFinder
   ```

2. **Run the Script:**

   Simply double-click the `HWIDFinder.bat` file to execute the script.

   Alternatively, you can run it from the command line:

   ```bash
   HWIDFinder.bat
   ```

3. **View Hardware Information:**

   - The script will display an animated sequence before showing the following information:
     - UUID
     - Serial Number
     - Model Name
     - Manufacturer

4. **Pause for Review:**

   - The script pauses at the end so you can review the information before closing the window.

## Example Output üì∏

When you run the script, you'll see an animation followed by the hardware information, like this:

```
Finding UID
....

Retrieving hardware information...
UUID: xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
IdentifyingNumber: xxxxxxxxxx
Name: YourPCModel
Vendor: YourManufacturer
```

## Customization üõ†Ô∏è

- **Animation Speed:** You can adjust the delay between the animation dots by modifying the `ping` command in the `:animation_loop` section.
- **Additional Info:** Feel free to add more `WMIC` commands if you need additional hardware details.

## Troubleshooting üõ†Ô∏è

- **WMIC Command Not Found:** Ensure you're running the script on a Windows system where `WMIC` is available.
- **No Output:** If the hardware information isn't displayed, double-check your script for any syntax errors.
